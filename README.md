    <p><b>Step 10: Test IP Connectivity To The Internet By Pinging Google Server 8.8.8.8</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 11: Test DNS And Website Connectivity By Using The Web Browser On Each Host To Access Www.Google.Com</b></p>
    <h2><strong><u>Implementation</u></strong></h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Connect One Cisco 7960 VOIP Phone To Each HQ Access Switch</h3>
            <p>- First, we'll connect and configure two more phones. We'll add two 7960 IP phones to the network in the HQ network topology. We'll place one phone under HQ-ASW2 and label it "x1002" and the other phone directly under HQ-ASW3 and label it "x1003".</p>

        <h3>Step 3: On The HQ Voice Router Configure The Three Ephones That Were Just Connected</h3>
            <p>- Next, we'll access the HQ-VOICE-RTR CLI and configure the two new ephones.</p>

            <p><em>- After reloading the router, you can see that the uck9 licensing software was installed successfully.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 4: Test Dialing By Extension Between Each HQ Phone</h3>
            <p>- Next we will place calls between each phone by dialing the extensions from each phone.</p>

            <p><em>- We are successfully able to call between all 3 ephones.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 5: Test Outbound Dialing To The PSTN Test Phone 8885551111</h3>
                <img width="1750" height="879" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-14 170432" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eee39c7-1495-4d7f-b29d-6378ab25e786" />
            <p><em>- Successful.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 6: Test Inbound Dialing To HQ External Phone Number(s) <em>(Lab Configuration Not Supported)</h3>
        <h3>Step 7: On The HQ Server Access The DHCP Services And Configure DHCP For The Data Network</h3>
            <p>- Next, we will add a server to the topology and configure NTP and DHCP services.</p>
                <p>- A: We'll start by adding the HQ-Server and testing network connectivity.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Connect A Host Directly To Each Of The Three Cisco 7960 VoIP Phones That Were Just Connected To The Network</h3>
                <p>- Next, we'll add 3 DHCP Hosts to the topology and confirm they pull addresses and have network access.</p>
